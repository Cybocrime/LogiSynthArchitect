# ⚡ LogiSynth | Systems Architecture & Strategic Engineering

**Orchestrating complexity. Eliminating leakage. Shipping truth.**

I am a Strategic Systems Architect. I don't build apps; I engineer ecosystems. By leveraging AI as a high-velocity production engine, I bypass the syntax grind to focus 100% on **Logic, Data Integrity, and Modular Infrastructure.**

### 🏛️ The LogiSynth Pillars
* **Zero Leakage:** Strict separation of concerns. Logic belongs in services, not the UI layer.
* **Offline-First Reliability:** Building resilient systems for high-latency and zero-connectivity environments.
* **Schema-Driven Development:** Data is the foundation; code is merely the delivery mechanism.
* **AI-Augmented Velocity:** Mastering AI orchestration to out-pace traditional manual workflows without sacrificing engineering quality.

### 🏗️ Current Build: The Mist (Automotive CRM)
*LogiSynth’s flagship industrial engine.*
* **The Problem:** Fragmented global vehicle data and unreliable connectivity for automotive security professionals.
* **The Solution:** A high-performance, modular CRM with sub-second transponder search and robust offline synchronization.
* **Tech Stack:** React, TypeScript, Capacitor, IndexedDB.

---

### 🛠️ Technical Arsenal
* **Architectures:** Modular Monoliths, Micro-Frontends, Serverless.
* **Foundations:** React, TypeScript, Python, Rust.
* **Mobile:** Capacitor, Flutter.
* **Data:** IndexedDB, PostgreSQL, Complex Schema Design.

### 📈 Traceability
* **Status:** Architecting "The Mist" Sync Engine.
* **Philosophy:** "Architecture is the art of deciding what NOT to build."
